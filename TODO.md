– [ ] Associations: include two chained associations
– [ ] Associations: mandatory true/false (JOIN vs LEFT JOIN)
– [ ] Associations: allow to give an alias, so that one can use an alias in an ORDER BY clause
    - [X] Person.include(Person.birthCountry.aliased("customCountryAlias"))
    - [ ] Person.aliased("customPersonAlias").include(Person.birthCountry) 
- [X] Association: Type.include() instead of Type.all().include()
- [ ] Association: Type.join() instead of Type.all().join()
- [ ] Association: .include() adds a variant, .join() does not add a variant
– [?] Association: distinguishing BelongsTo and HasOne could help verifying that the right table of belongsTo has a unique index on the joined columns. For HasOne, we have to trust the user. 
- [ ] FetchedRecordsController: document that identity comparison is only required for table view events.
- [ ] FetchedRecordsController: see if we can replace identity comparison function with a function that returns an Equatable value (beware the generics trouble). See if this can help optimize memory use, and use a sortedMerge() algorithm.
- [ ] GRDBCipher: remove limitations on iOS or OS X versions
- [ ] FetchedRecordsController: take inspiration from https://github.com/jflinter/Dwifft
- [ ] What is the SQLITE_OPEN_WAL open flag?
- [ ] File protection: Read https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb/issues/262 and understand https://lists.apple.com/archives/cocoa-dev/2012/Aug/msg00527.html
- [ ] Support for resource values (see https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1719/_index.html)
- [ ] DOC: Since commit e6010e334abdf98eb9f62c1d6abbb2a9e8cd7d19, one can not use the raw SQLite API without importing the SQLite module for the platform. We need to document that.
- [ ] Query builder
    - [ ] SELECT readers.*, books.* FROM ... JOIN ...
    - [ ] date functions
    - [ ] NOW
    - [ ] RANDOM() https://www.sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html
    - [ ] LIKE https://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html
    - [ ] GLOB https://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html
    - [ ] MATCH https://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html
    - [ ] REGEXP https://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html
    - [ ] CASE x WHEN w1 THEN r1 WHEN w2 THEN r2 ELSE r3 END https://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html

Not sure:

- [ ] Make FetchRequest adopt Equatable
- [ ] Turn DatabaseWriter.readFromWrite to Database.readFromCurrentState { ... } ?
- [ ] Refactor errors in a single type?
- [ ] Since Records' primary key are infered, no operation is possible on the primary key unless we have a Database instance. It's impossible to define the record.primaryKey property, or to provide a copy() function that does not clone the primary key: they miss the database that is the only object aware of the primary key. Should we change our mind, and have Record explicitly expose their primary key again?
- [ ] Have Record adopt Hashable and Equatable, based on primary key. Problem: we can't do it know because we don't know the primary key until we have a database connection.


Difficult:

- [ ] In-memory DatabasePool (https://www.sqlite.org/inmemorydb.html). Unfortunately, a shared cache is not enough, and SQLite does not provide WAL mode for in-memory databases: we get "database is locked" errors. A solution could be a WAL database on a RAM disk, and this is difficult.


Require changes in the Swift language:

- [ ] Specific and optimized Optional<StatementColumnConvertible>.fetch... methods when http://openradar.appspot.com/22852669 is fixed.


Requires recompilation of SQLite:

- [ ] https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/column_database_name.html could help extracting out of a row a subrow only made of columns that come from a specific table. Requires SQLITE_ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA which is not set on the sqlite3 lib that ships with OSX.
